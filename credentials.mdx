# API Keys & Credentials

Your project has several credentials. Here's what each one does and where to find them.

## Project ID

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | Public identifier for your project |
| **Format** | `proj_xxxxxxxx` |
| **Where** | Project Settings → General |
| **Safe to expose** | Yes |

Used to identify your project in API calls. Can be safely included in client-side code.

## Project Slug

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | URL-friendly project identifier |
| **Format** | `your-app-name` |
| **Where** | Project Settings → General |
| **Safe to expose** | Yes |

Used in your portal URL: `https://featkit.com/p/[slug]`

You choose this when creating your project. It's public and appears in the portal URL your users see.

## Secret Key

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | Used to sign authentication tokens |
| **Format** | `sk_live_xxxxxxxx` |
| **Where** | Project Settings → Signed Links |
| **Safe to expose** | **NO — backend only** |

<Warning>
**Never expose your Secret Key in client code.** This key is used to sign Signed Links and must remain on your backend.
</Warning>

## Rotating credentials

If your Secret Key is compromised:

1. Go to **Project Settings → Signed Links**
2. Click **"Rotate Secret Key"**
3. Update your backend with the new key
4. Old key stops working immediately

<Note>
Rotating your Secret Key will invalidate all existing signed links. Users will need to open fresh links from your app.
</Note>
