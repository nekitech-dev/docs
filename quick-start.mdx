# Quick Start

Add a feature request portal to your iOS app in 5 minutes. Your users can submit ideas, vote, and see your roadmap — all with a single link.

## Step 1: Create your project

1. Sign up at [featkit.io](https://featkit.io)
2. Create a project (usually one per app)
3. Your portal is live immediately at: `https://featkit.io/p/[your-project-slug]`

## Step 2: Get your credentials

1. Go to **Project Settings → Signed Links**
2. Copy your **Project ID** and **Secret Key**
3. You'll use these to authenticate users

## Step 3: Add to your app

Open the portal from anywhere in your app:

```swift
import SafariServices

func openFeatKitPortal() {
    let url = URL(string: "https://featkit.io/p/your-project-slug")!
    let safari = SFSafariViewController(url: url)
    present(safari, animated: true)
}
```

## Step 4: Authenticate users (recommended)

So users don't need to create accounts, pass their identity via Signed Links.
